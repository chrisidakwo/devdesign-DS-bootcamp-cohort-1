# The Great Tech Stock Volatility Crisis: Building an Early Warning System for Investment Risk Management

## 1. Project Title & Overview

**Project Title:** "The Great Tech Stock Volatility Crisis: Building an Early Warning System for Investment Risk Management"

You are tasked with developing a comprehensive volatility analysis and early warning system that could have predicted and managed the massive tech stock crash of 2022. This project will challenge you to think like a quantitative analyst at a major investment firm, using real market data to build predictive models that protect investor capital.

By the end of this project, you'll have built a complete risk management dashboard that combines statistical analysis, machine learning, and financial theory to predict periods of high volatility in tech stocks. This project bridges the gap between academic data science and real-world financial applications, giving you practical experience in one of the most data-driven industries in the world.

## 2. Background & Context

The technology sector experienced unprecedented volatility in 2022, with major companies like Meta losing over 70% of their value, Netflix dropping 50%, and the NASDAQ composite falling into bear market territory. Nigerian investment firms, like their global counterparts, found their portfolios devastated by this unexpected crash. Traditional risk management approaches failed to predict the severity and duration of the downturn.

Modern investment firms rely heavily on quantitative analysis to manage risk and protect client assets. The 2022 tech crash was particularly challenging because it coincided with rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions, and changing consumer behavior post-COVID. This creates an opportunity to develop new approaches that incorporate multiple data sources and modern machine learning techniques to better predict and manage portfolio risk.

## 3. Project Description

You will develop a volatility analysis and prediction system focused on major technology stocks during the 2020-2023 period, with particular emphasis on the 2022 crash. The project requires you to build both descriptive analytics (understanding what happened) and predictive models (forecasting future volatility).

Your analysis must include basic statistical analysis of stock price movements, calculation of volatility measures, correlation analysis between major tech stocks, identification of high-volatility periods, and development of a machine learning model to predict future volatility periods. You'll analyze 5-6 major technology companies using daily price data from 2021-2023, focusing on understanding volatility patterns and building a simple early warning system.

## 4. Data and Constraints

**Primary Dataset:** Stock price data for 5-6 major technology companies (Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, Tesla), available from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance Python library. The dataset includes daily closing prices and volume for 2021-2023 (approximately 500-600 data points per stock).

**Technical Constraints:** Use Python with pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib/seaborn for visualizations, and scikit-learn for machine learning. Focus on libraries covered in the bootcamp. Avoid complex financial libraries - stick to basic Python data science tools.

**Business Constraints:** Keep the analysis practical and understandable. Focus on clear insights that can be explained to non-technical stakeholders. The goal is to demonstrate your data science skills, not become a financial expert.

## 5. Expected Deliverables

**1. Jupyter Notebook Analysis (45% of grade)**
- Data loading and basic cleaning (handling missing values, date formatting)
- Exploratory data analysis with 5-8 clear visualizations showing price trends and volatility
- Simple statistical analysis (calculating daily returns, rolling volatility, correlations)
- Implementation of 1 machine learning model to predict high/low volatility periods
- Model evaluation using basic metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix)

**2. Technical Report (40% of grade)**
- 4-8 page report summarizing your analysis and findings
- Include key visualizations with explanations
- Simple recommendations for the investment firm
- Written in clear, non-technical language suitable for business stakeholders

**3. Presentation (15% of grade)**
- A presentation slide document with 5-10 slides, that:
  - Focuses on your main findings and what they mean for investors
  - Includes 2-3 key visualizations
  - Practices explaining technical concepts in simple terms

All code should be well-commented to show your understanding. Focus on clarity and completeness rather than complexity.
