# COVID-19 Retail Recovery Strategy: Rebuilding Shopping Centers for the New Normal

## 1. Project Title & Overview

**Project Title:** "COVID-19 Retail Recovery Strategy: Rebuilding Shopping Centers for the New Normal"

You are a Data Analyst for Palms Shopping Mall, helping them understand how COVID-19 changed customer shopping habits and develop strategies to recover lost business. Your job is to analyze sales data from before, during, and after the pandemic to identify new trends and recommend how the mall should adapt.

You'll compare shopping patterns across different time periods, identify which stores and product categories recovered fastest, and build models to predict future sales. This project shows how data science helps businesses adapt to major disruptions and plan for recovery.

## 2. Background & Context

The COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted the retail sector globally, with shopping malls experiencing 60-80% drops in foot traffic during lockdowns. Many stores closed permanently, while others shifted to online sales or delivery services.

Consumers changed their shopping habits during the pandemic - buying more groceries and household items, shopping less frequently but in larger quantities, and increasingly using online platforms. Some changes may be permanent, while others might return to pre-pandemic patterns.

Palms Shopping Mall needs to understand these changes to make smart decisions about tenant mix, store layouts, marketing strategies, and future investments. Your analysis will help them plan their recovery strategy and adapt to the new retail landscape.

## 3. Project Description

You will analyze retail sales data from 2019-2022 to understand how COVID-19 affected shopping patterns and identify recovery strategies. Your tasks include: comparing sales before, during, and after COVID-19 lockdowns, identifying which product categories and stores were most affected, analyzing changes in customer shopping frequency and spending patterns, and predicting future sales trends.

You'll work with retail sales data covering multiple time periods and product categories, including transaction amounts, dates, store types, and basic customer information. The analysis focuses on understanding business impact and recovery rather than complex epidemiological modeling.

Use basic Python skills from the bootcamp: pandas for data analysis, matplotlib for visualizations, and simple statistical methods. The goal is to provide clear insights about how the pandemic changed retail and what Palms Mall should do to recover.

## 4. Data and Constraints

**Primary Dataset:** Retail sales data from Kaggle covering 2019-2022 period, including transaction data from various store categories (fashion, electronics, groceries, restaurants, etc.) with dates, amounts, and store information. The dataset includes approximately 50,000+ transactions across different time periods.

**Technical Constraints:** Use Python with pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib/seaborn for visualizations, and basic statistical analysis. Focus on libraries covered in the bootcamp. Avoid complex time series libraries - stick to simple trend analysis and comparisons.

**Business Constraints:** Consider Nigerian market context - different lockdown periods, consumer behavior, and economic factors. Focus on practical recommendations that a mall management team can implement. Keep analysis understandable for retail executives who need to make investment decisions.
