# The Global Learning Crisis Response: Data-Driven Education Policy for the United States

## 1. Project Title & Overview

**Project Title:** "The Global Learning Crisis Response: Data-Driven Education Policy for the United States"

You are a Data Analyst for the U.S. Department of Education, helping to understand why educational outcomes vary across countries and what policies can improve student performance. Your job is to analyze global education data to identify successful strategies that the United States can adopt.

You'll use World Bank and UNESCO education data to build models that predict educational success, identify the most effective policy interventions, and recommend specific actions for improving the U.S. education system. This project shows how data science can guide evidence-based education policy.

## 2. Background & Context

The United States faces ongoing education challenges with achievement gaps, declining international rankings in key subjects, and concerns about preparing students for the modern economy. The Department of Education needs to understand which factors most effectively improve educational performance to guide federal policy and resource allocation.

Countries with similar economic conditions have achieved dramatically different education outcomes through various policy approaches. Understanding the relationship between education spending, teacher training, infrastructure investment, and student performance can guide United States' education strategy.

Your analysis will help the Department identify which interventions offer the highest return on investment and develop policies based on successful examples from high-performing countries worldwide.

## 3. Project Description

You will analyze global education data, spending patterns, and policy indicators to predict educational outcomes and recommend improvement strategies. Your tasks include: exploring relationships between education investment and student performance, identifying countries with similar profiles that achieved better outcomes, building models to predict the impact of different policy interventions, and analyzing which factors most influence educational success.

You'll work with World Bank education statistics containing literacy rates, enrollment figures, and spending data by country, UNESCO data on education policies and outcomes, and basic economic indicators for context. The analysis focuses on finding practical policy insights for the United States' context.

Use basic Python skills from the bootcamp: pandas for data analysis, matplotlib for visualizations, and simple machine learning models. The goal is to provide clear recommendations for education policy improvements based on global evidence.

## 4. Data and Constraints

**Primary Dataset:** World Bank Education Statistics (2010-2020) containing enrollment rates, literacy levels, education spending, and teacher ratios by country, UNESCO Global Education Monitoring data including policy indicators and learning outcomes, and basic economic data (GDP per capita, population) for country comparisons. The dataset covers approximately 10 years of data across 150+ countries.

**Technical Constraints:** Use Python with pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib/seaborn for visualizations, and scikit-learn for basic machine learning. Focus on libraries covered in the bootcamp. Avoid complex econometric modeling - stick to simple prediction and correlation analysis.

**Business Constraints:** Consider U.S. context - federal vs. state education responsibilities, diverse demographic challenges, and implementation across different school systems. Focus on evidence-based recommendations that can realistically be implemented within the American education system. Keep analysis understandable for education policymakers who need actionable guidance.

## 5. Expected Deliverables

**1. Jupyter Notebook Analysis (45% of grade)**
- Data cleaning and exploration of education outcomes, spending, and policy data
- Analysis of relationships between investment levels and educational performance
- Country comparison analysis showing successful improvement strategies
- Regional and income-level benchmarking for the U.S. position among developed nations
- Simple machine learning model to predict education outcomes based on policy factors
- Feature importance analysis showing key drivers of educational success

**2. Education Policy Strategy Report (40% of grade)**
- 4-8 page policy report with specific recommendations for the U.S. Department of Education
- Include identification of highest-impact interventions based on global evidence
- Benchmarking analysis against other developed countries with high-performing education systems
- Resource allocation recommendations based on prediction models
- Implementation roadmap for priority education improvements
- Written for education policymakers who need evidence-based guidance

**3. Ministry Leadership Presentation (15% of grade)**
- 8-10 slide presentation for Department of Education leadership focusing on:
    - Key findings about factors driving educational success globally
    - 3-4 clear visualizations showing the U.S. position and improvement opportunities
    - Specific policy recommendations based on successful country examples
    - Expected impact and timeline for proposed education interventions

All analysis should prioritize practical policy implementation and realistic improvement targets over complex technical methods.
