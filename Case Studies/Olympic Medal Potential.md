# Olympic Medal Potential Analysis: Strategic Sports Investment for Nigeria's Olympic Success

## 1. Project Title & Overview

**Project Title:** "Olympic Medal Potential Analysis: Strategic Sports Investment for Nigeria's Olympic Success"

You are a Data Scientist for the Nigerian Olympic Committee, helping to identify which sports offer the best opportunities for Olympic medals. Your job is to analyze historical Olympic data and country characteristics to guide investment decisions for the next Olympic cycle.

You'll use Olympic Games data and economic indicators to build models that predict medal potential, identify Nigeria's competitive advantages, and recommend which sports deserve increased funding. This project shows how data science can optimize resource allocation in sports development.

## 2. Background & Context

Nigeria has competed in the Olympics since 1952 but has won only 25 medals total, mostly in athletics and boxing. With limited sports development funding, the Nigerian Olympic Committee must strategically invest in sports where the country has the highest medal potential.

Countries with similar economic profiles, population sizes, and development levels provide valuable benchmarks for understanding realistic medal targets. Climate, culture, and existing infrastructure also influence which sports offer the best opportunities for success.

Your analysis will help the Committee allocate training resources, coaching investments, and athlete development programs to sports with the highest probability of Olympic medals based on data-driven insights.

## 3. Project Description

You will analyze Olympic medal data, country economic indicators, and demographic information to predict Nigeria's medal potential across different sports. Your tasks include: exploring relationships between country characteristics and Olympic success, identifying sports where similar countries excel, building models to predict medal potential by sport, and analyzing which factors most influence Olympic performance.

You'll work with historical Olympic Games data containing medals by country and sport, World Bank economic data including GDP, population, and development indicators, and sports participation data. The analysis focuses on finding actionable patterns for sports investment decisions.

Use basic Python skills from the bootcamp: pandas for data analysis, matplotlib for visualizations, and simple machine learning models. The goal is to provide clear recommendations for where Nigeria should focus Olympic development efforts.

## 4. Data and Constraints

**Primary Dataset:** Historical Olympic Games data from Kaggle (1896-2020) containing medals by country, sport, and athlete demographics, World Bank country indicators including GDP per capita, population, education levels, and climate data, and sports infrastructure data by country. The dataset covers approximately 120 years of Olympic history across 200+ countries.

**Technical Constraints:** Use Python with pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib/seaborn for visualizations, and scikit-learn for basic machine learning. Focus on libraries covered in the bootcamp. Avoid complex sports science modeling - stick to simple prediction and correlation analysis.

**Business Constraints:** Consider Nigerian context - current sports infrastructure, cultural preferences, and funding limitations. Focus on realistic medal opportunities rather than traditionally dominant sports. Keep analysis practical for Olympic Committee decision-making with limited resources.
