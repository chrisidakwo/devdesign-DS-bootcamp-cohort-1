# Campaign Finance Impact Analysis: Understanding Money's Influence on U.S. Elections

## 1. Project Title & Overview

**Project Title:** "Campaign Finance Impact Analysis: Understanding Money's Influence on U.S. Elections"

You are a Data Analyst for a political transparency organization, investigating how campaign spending affects electoral outcomes across different types of races. Your job is to analyze FEC campaign finance data and election results to understand the relationship between money and political success.

You'll use Federal Election Commission data and election results to build models that predict electoral success based on spending patterns, identify races where money matters most, and analyze funding sources' impact on outcomes. This project shows how data science can promote transparency and inform democratic discourse.

## 2. Background & Context

Campaign finance remains a critical issue in American democracy, with ongoing debates about whether money gives unfair advantages to certain candidates. Political transparency organizations need data-driven insights to inform public policy discussions and voter education efforts.

Different types of elections (presidential, congressional, state-level) show varying relationships between spending and success. Understanding these patterns helps identify where campaign finance reforms might have the greatest impact and informs voters about funding influences on their representatives.

Your analysis will help the organization provide evidence-based insights about money's role in elections and support their mission of promoting transparency in the democratic process.

## 3. Project Description

You will analyze campaign finance data, election results, and candidate information to understand spending's impact on electoral success. Your tasks include: exploring relationships between campaign spending and vote margins, identifying election types where money matters most, building models to predict electoral outcomes based on financial factors, and analyzing different funding sources' effectiveness.

You'll work with FEC campaign finance data containing contributions, expenditures, and donor information by candidate, election results data showing vote counts and margins across different races, and basic candidate demographic information. The analysis focuses on finding clear patterns in money's influence on elections.

Use basic Python skills from the bootcamp: pandas for data analysis, matplotlib for visualizations, and simple machine learning models. The goal is to provide evidence-based insights about campaign finance's role in American elections.

## 4. Data and Constraints

**Primary Dataset:** FEC campaign finance data (2016-2020) containing individual contributions, expenditures, and PAC funding by candidate and race, election results from data.gov including vote totals, margins, and candidate information across federal and state races, and basic demographic data about candidates and districts. The dataset covers approximately 4 years of election cycles across thousands of races.

**Technical Constraints:** Use Python with pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib/seaborn for visualizations, and scikit-learn for basic machine learning. Focus on libraries covered in the bootcamp. Avoid complex political science modeling - stick to simple prediction and correlation analysis.

**Business Constraints:** Consider legal and ethical aspects of campaign finance analysis - focus on publicly available data and avoid partisan interpretations. Present findings objectively to support democratic transparency rather than advocate for specific policies. Keep analysis understandable for general public and media consumption.

## 5. Expected Deliverables

**1. Jupyter Notebook Analysis (45% of grade)**
- Data cleaning and exploration of campaign finance and election results data
- Analysis of relationships between spending levels and electoral success rates
- Comparison across different election types (House, Senate, gubernatorial, etc.)
- Funding source analysis showing impact of individual vs. PAC contributions
- Simple machine learning model to predict election outcomes based on financial factors
- Feature importance analysis showing which financial metrics matter most

**2. Transparency Research Report (40% of grade)**
- 4-8 page research report with objective findings about money's influence on elections
- Include identification of election types where spending has strongest correlation with success
- Analysis of spending patterns and their relationship to electoral outcomes
- Comparison of different funding strategies and their effectiveness
- Summary of key insights for public understanding of campaign finance impacts
- Written for transparency advocates, journalists, and informed citizens

**3. Public Education Presentation (15% of grade)**
- 6-10 slide presentation for public education focusing on:
    - Key findings about campaign spending's relationship to electoral success
    - 3-4 clear visualizations showing money's influence across different race types
    - Objective insights about campaign finance patterns in American elections
    - Data-driven context for ongoing campaign finance policy discussions

All analysis should maintain political neutrality and focus on factual insights rather than advocacy positions.
