# Demographic Voting Pattern Analysis: Understanding American Electoral Behavior

## 1. Project Title & Overview

**Project Title:** "Demographic Voting Pattern Analysis: Understanding American Electoral Behavior"

You work for a political science research institute as a Data Scientist, tasked with investigating how demographic factors influence voting patterns across the United States. Your job is to analyze election results and census data to understand the relationship between voter characteristics and electoral choices.

You'll use election results and demographic data to build models that predict voting patterns, identify key factors that influence electoral behavior, and analyze geographic variations in voting trends. This project shows how data science can advance academic understanding of democratic participation and electoral dynamics.

## 2. Background & Context

Understanding voting patterns is fundamental to political science research and helps explain how demographic changes affect electoral outcomes. Research institutes need data-driven insights to study democratic participation, electoral representation, and the evolving American political landscape.

Different demographic groups show distinct voting preferences that vary by election type, geographic region, and time period. Analyzing these patterns helps researchers understand voter behavior, predict electoral trends, and inform academic discussions about representation and democratic participation.

Your analysis will help the institute contribute to scholarly understanding of American electoral behavior and provide evidence-based insights for academic research and public policy discussions.

## 3. Project Description

You will analyze election results, census demographic data, and geographic information to understand voting patterns across different populations. Your tasks include: exploring relationships between demographic characteristics and voting preferences, identifying geographic patterns in electoral behavior, building models to predict voting outcomes based on demographic factors, and analyzing how different demographic variables interact to influence elections.

You'll work with election results data showing vote counts and percentages by geographic area, census demographic data including age, income, education, and race by county and district, and geographic data for mapping voting patterns. The analysis focuses on finding statistical relationships between demographics and electoral choices.

Use basic Python skills from the bootcamp: pandas for data analysis, matplotlib for visualizations, and simple machine learning models. The goal is to provide research-quality insights about demographic influences on American voting behavior.

## 4. Data and Constraints

**Primary Dataset:** Election results from data.gov (2016-2020) containing vote totals and percentages by county, district, and state across multiple election cycles, U.S. Census demographic data including age distribution, income levels, education attainment, and racial composition by geographic area, and geographic boundary data for mapping electoral patterns. The dataset covers thousands of counties and districts across multiple election cycles.

**Technical Constraints:** Use Python with pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib/seaborn for visualizations, and scikit-learn for basic machine learning. Focus on libraries covered in the bootcamp. Avoid complex statistical modeling - stick to simple prediction and correlation analysis appropriate for academic research.

**Business Constraints:** Maintain academic objectivity and avoid partisan interpretations of voting patterns. Focus on statistical relationships rather than political commentary. Present findings in a scholarly manner appropriate for academic research and peer review. Consider privacy and aggregation requirements for demographic analysis.

## 5. Expected Deliverables

**1. Jupyter Notebook Analysis (45% of grade)**
- Data cleaning and exploration of election results and demographic data by geographic area
- Analysis of correlations between demographic variables and voting patterns
- Geographic mapping and visualization of electoral trends across different regions
- Comparison of voting patterns across different demographic groups and election types
- Simple machine learning model to predict voting outcomes based on demographic characteristics
- Feature importance analysis showing which demographic factors most influence electoral behavior

**2. Academic Research Report (40% of grade)**
- 4-8 page scholarly report analyzing demographic influences on American voting patterns
- Include statistical analysis of relationships between demographics and electoral outcomes
- Geographic analysis showing regional variations in voting behavior
- Comparison across different election types and time periods
- Discussion of findings' implications for understanding electoral representation
- Written in academic style appropriate for political science research publication

**3. Research Institute Presentation (15% of grade)**
- 6-10 slide presentation for academic researchers focusing on:
    - Key statistical findings about demographic influences on voting behavior
    - 3-4 clear visualizations showing geographic and demographic voting patterns
    - Research insights about electoral representation and demographic trends
    - Implications for future political science research and democratic participation studies

All analysis should maintain scholarly objectivity and focus on statistical insights rather than political advocacy.
