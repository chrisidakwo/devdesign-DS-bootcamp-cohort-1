# Maternal Mortality Reduction Strategy: Protecting Nigerian Mothers Through Data-Driven Healthcare

## 1. Project Title & Overview

**Project Title:** "Maternal Mortality Reduction Strategy: Protecting Nigerian Mothers Through Data-Driven Healthcare"

You are a Data Scientist for UNICEF Nigeria, helping to reduce maternal mortality rates across the country. Your job is to analyze maternal health data and demographic factors to identify where mothers face the highest risks and recommend targeted intervention programs.

You'll use WHO health data and World Bank demographic information to understand what factors contribute to maternal deaths, identify high-risk regions and communities, and predict where interventions will have the greatest impact. This project shows how data science can help save mothers' lives through better healthcare planning.

## 2. Background & Context

Nigeria has one of the world's highest maternal mortality rates, with approximately 814 deaths per 100,000 live births. Most of these deaths are preventable with proper healthcare access, skilled birth attendants, and timely medical interventions.

Maternal mortality varies significantly across Nigeria's regions, with northern states generally having higher rates than southern states. Factors like poverty, education levels, healthcare facility access, and cultural practices all influence maternal health outcomes.

UNICEF Nigeria needs data-driven insights to allocate limited resources effectively, focusing interventions where they can save the most lives. Your analysis will help identify priority areas and design targeted programs to reduce maternal deaths across the country.

## 3. Project Description

You will analyze maternal health and demographic data to identify risk factors and predict high-risk regions for targeted interventions. Your tasks include: exploring relationships between demographic factors and maternal mortality rates, identifying states and regions with highest risk, analyzing which factors most strongly predict maternal deaths, and building simple models to guide intervention planning.

You'll work with WHO maternal health data by state, World Bank demographic data including education, poverty, and healthcare access indicators, and basic geographic information. The analysis focuses on finding actionable patterns for public health interventions.

Use basic Python skills from your bootcamp: pandas for data analysis, matplotlib for visualizations, and simple statistical methods. The goal is to provide clear recommendations for where UNICEF should focus their maternal health programs.

## 4. Data and Constraints

**Primary Dataset:** WHO maternal mortality data for Nigeria by state, World Bank demographic indicators including education levels, poverty rates, healthcare facility density, and birth attendance rates. The dataset covers Nigeria's 36 states with key indicators from recent years.

**Technical Constraints:** Use Python with pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib/seaborn for visualizations, and basic statistical analysis. Focus on libraries covered in the bootcamp. Avoid complex epidemiological modeling - stick to simple correlation analysis and comparison methods.

**Business Constraints:** Consider Nigerian context - cultural factors, resource limitations, and regional differences. Focus on practical recommendations that UNICEF can implement with available funding. Keep analysis understandable for program managers who need to design and deploy interventions.

## 5. Expected Deliverables

- State-by-state analysis showing maternal mortality patterns
- Correlation analysis between demographic factors and maternal deaths
- Risk factor identification and ranking
- Simple predictive model for high-risk areas
- Geographic analysis showing priority regions for intervention

**2. Program Strategy Report (45% of grade)**
- 4-8 page program report with specific recommendations for UNICEF Nigeria
- Include identification of highest-risk states and communities
- Key risk factors analysis with intervention suggestions
- Resource allocation recommendations based on data insights
- Timeline and targeting strategies for maternal health programs
- Written for program managers who need to design and implement interventions

**3. UNICEF Leadership Presentation (10% of grade)**
- A presentation slide for UNICEF Nigeria leadership team, that:
  - Focuses on key findings about maternal mortality risk factors
  - Includes 3-4 clear visualizations showing risk patterns and priorities
  - Presents specific recommendations for program design and targeting
  - Explains how data analysis can improve program effectiveness and save lives

All analysis should prioritize practical impact and program implementation over complex technical methods.
