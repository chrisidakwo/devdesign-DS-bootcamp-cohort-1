# Emerging Markets Investment Strategy: Building a Diversification Framework for Nigerian Pension Funds

## 1. Project Title & Overview

**Project Title:** "Emerging Markets Investment Strategy: Building a Diversification Framework for Nigerian Pension Funds"

You are a Data Analyst working for the National Pension Commission (PenCom) in Nigeria. Your task is to evaluate emerging markets for potential investment opportunities and create a risk-return framework that will help Nigerian pension fund administrators make informed diversification decisions. You'll analyze economic indicators from multiple emerging economies to identify the most attractive investment destinations.

By the end of this project, you'll have developed a comprehensive investment screening system that ranks emerging markets based on economic stability, growth potential, and risk factors. You'll create data-driven recommendations that could influence how billions of naira in pension funds are allocated across global markets, directly impacting the retirement security of millions of Nigerian workers.

## 2. Background & Context

Nigerian pension funds currently hold over â‚¦15 trillion in assets, with most investments concentrated in domestic markets. However, economic volatility, currency fluctuations, and limited domestic investment opportunities have created an urgent need for international diversification. Emerging markets offer attractive growth potential but come with significant risks that must be carefully evaluated.

The National Pension Commission is considering allowing pension fund administrators to increase their allocation to emerging markets from the current 5% to 15% of total assets. This policy change could redirect hundreds of billions of naira into international markets, making proper risk assessment crucial. Recent global events have shown how quickly emerging market conditions can change, requiring robust analytical frameworks to guide investment decisions.

## 3. Project Description

You will develop a comprehensive emerging markets investment analysis system that evaluates and ranks potential investment destinations based on economic indicators and risk factors. The project requires both descriptive analysis of current market conditions and predictive modeling to forecast future performance.

Your analysis must include comparative economic analysis across 4-6 emerging markets, calculation of risk-return metrics for each country, correlation analysis to identify diversification benefits, identification of key economic indicators that predict market performance, and development of a machine learning model to classify markets as "High Potential," "Moderate Potential," or "High Risk." You'll work with economic data spanning 2018-2023 to understand how different markets performed through various global events including COVID-19 and recent geopolitical tensions.

## 4. Data and Constraints

**Primary Dataset:** World Bank economic indicators (GDP growth, inflation, unemployment, debt levels, trade balance) and Kaggle emerging markets dataset (stock market indices, currency exchange rates, foreign investment flows). Data covers 8-10 emerging markets including Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, Turkey, Malaysia, and others for 2018-2023.

**Technical Constraints:** Use Python with pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib/seaborn for visualizations, and scikit-learn for machine learning. Focus on libraries covered in bootcamp. Work with publicly available economic datasets that don't require specialized financial data providers.

**Business Constraints:** Focus on practical recommendations that pension fund managers can implement. Consider currency risk and political stability factors that are critical for long-term pension investments.

## 5. Expected Deliverables

**1. Jupyter Notebook Analysis (45% of grade)**
- Data loading and cleaning from multiple sources (World Bank API, CSV files)
- Exploratory data analysis with 6-8 visualizations comparing markets across key indicators
- Statistical analysis including correlation matrix, risk-return calculations, and country rankings
- Implementation of 1 machine learning model to classify investment attractiveness
- Model evaluation with clear interpretation of results for business stakeholders

**2. Investment Strategy Report (40% of grade)**
- 4-8 page report with executive summary and detailed country analysis
- Include key charts and risk-return comparisons
- Specific recommendations for pension fund allocation
- Written for pension fund managers and PenCom officials

**3. Presentation to Investment Committee (15% of grade)**
- Create a Presentation slides document that:
    - Presents your findings and recommendations to senior financial decision-makers 
    - Focus on top 3 recommended markets and rationale
    - Include risk mitigation strategies and implementation timeline

All analysis should demonstrate understanding of both technical implementation and business implications for pension fund management.
