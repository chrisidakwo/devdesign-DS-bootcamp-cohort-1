# The Black Friday Analytics Challenge: Driving Nigeria's Biggest Shopping Event with Data-Driven Strategy

## 1. Project Title & Overview

**Project Title:** "The Black Friday Analytics Challenge: Driving Nigeria's Biggest Shopping Event with Data-Driven Strategy"

You are a Data Analyst for ShopRite Nigeria, helping to plan their first Black Friday campaign. Your job is to analyze customer shopping data to recommend which products to promote, predict how much customers will buy, and estimate potential revenue.

You'll use retail sales data to understand customer behavior, identify popular products, and build simple models to forecast Black Friday sales. This project shows how data science helps retailers make better business decisions during major shopping events.

## 2. Background & Context

Black Friday is becoming popular in Nigeria, with retailers like Jumia and ShopRite using it to boost year-end sales. Nigerian shoppers prefer electronics, fashion, and household goods, but their buying patterns differ from Western markets.

ShopRite Nigeria wants to join this trend but needs data-driven insights to succeed. They need to know which products to promote, how much inventory to stock, and what discounts to offer. Poor planning could result in empty shelves or too much unsold stock.

Your analysis will help ShopRite make smart decisions about their Black Friday campaign using customer data and shopping patterns.

## 3. Project Description

You will analyze retail sales data to help ShopRite plan their Black Friday campaign. Your tasks include: grouping customers by their shopping behavior, identifying which products sell best and should be promoted, predicting how much customers will spend during Black Friday, and recommending discount strategies.

You'll work with a dataset containing customer information (age, gender, location) and their purchase history across different product categories. The analysis focuses on practical retail insights rather than complex financial modeling.

Use the Python skills from your bootcamp: pandas for data analysis, matplotlib for charts, and scikit-learn for simple machine learning models. The goal is to provide clear, actionable recommendations that ShopRite's business team can use to plan their campaign.

## 4. Data and Constraints

**Primary Dataset:** Black Friday sales dataset from Kaggle containing customer purchase data with demographics (age, gender, city category), product information (category, subcategory), and transaction details (purchase amounts). The dataset includes approximately 500,000+ transactions from multiple customers across various product categories.

**Technical Constraints:** Use Python with pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib/seaborn for visualizations, and scikit-learn for machine learning models. Focus on libraries covered in the bootcamp. Avoid complex retail-specific libraries - stick to fundamental data science tools.

**Business Constraints:** Consider Nigerian market context - different consumer preferences, payment methods, and economic factors compared to US/European markets. Focus on practical recommendations that a retail team can implement. Keep analysis interpretable for non-technical stakeholders including merchandising and marketing teams.
