    "In this tutorial, we used the linear regression model for our prediction, and that's because linear regression finds the straight line that best fits through your data points - which is what we want. We have an assumption to each feature contributes (in some way) to the determination of the price of a house. Hence, the linear regression model is our \"go-to\" approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "THe linear regression model is designed to create a pattern on how input variables (like area_sqm, number of bedrooms, house type, location, age, etc.) relate to an outcome (like price) and uses that pattern to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are some best scenarios to use it:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When you expect roughly straight-line relationships between inputs and outputs (like in the case of the housing dataset, where we expect that each feature has a positive correlation with the target variable - being the property price)\n",
    "2. When you need to understand which factors matter most (it tells you the importance of each variable)\n",
    "3. When you want a simple, fast model that's easy to interpret and explain\n",
    "4. For baseline predictions before trying more complex methods\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:** Predicting sales based on advertising spend, estimating delivery times based on distance and traffic, or forecasting energy usage based on temperature and building size.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why we calculate these metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To know if our model is any good - Without metrics, we're flying blind\n",
    "2. To compare different models - Which one performs better?\n",

    "4. To communicate results - \"Our model predicts house prices with 85% accuracy\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key insight:** We always compare training vs. testing metrics. If they're similar, great! If training is much better than testing, our model might be \"cheating\" by memorizing the training data."

    "\n",
    "1. The first argument in the train_test_split() function above takes in all our feature matrix (all input variables, eg: area_sqm, bedrooms, bathrooms, has_garage_encoded, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second argument in the train_test_split() function above takes in our target variable (the prices we want to predict)\n",
    " \n",
    "3. test_size=0.2: Means 20% of data goes to testing, 80% to training\n",
    "\n",
    "4. random_state=42: Sets a seed for reproducible results (you'll get the same split every time)\n",
    "\n",
    "### train_test_split() Function Return\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns 4 arrays in this specific order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. X_train: Training features (80% of our feature data). For example, if we have 40 houses in our dataset, the X_train variable will hold training features for 32 houses\n",
    "\n",
    "2. X_test: Testing features (20% of our feature data). For example, if we have 40 houses in our dataset, the X_test variable will hold testing features for 8 houses\n",
    "\n",
    "3. y_train: Training targets (80% of our price data). For example, if we have 40 houses in our dataset, the y_train variable will hold prices for those same 32 houses in X_train. It is a 1D array of the actual outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. y_test: Testing targets (20% of our price data). For example, if we have 40 houses in our dataset, the y_test variable will hold prices for those same 8 houses in X_test\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this split is important?\n",
    "This split is important to:\n",
    "1. **Train the model** using `X_train` and `y_train`\n",
    "2. **Test the model** by predicting `X_test` and comparing with `y_test`\n",
    "3. **Evaluate performance** - if the model predicts well on unseen data (`X_test`), it's likely to work well on completely new houses\n",
    "\n",
    "### The matching relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "The split ensures that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. X_train[i] corresponds to y_train[i] (same house)\n",
    "2. X_test[i] corresponds to y_test[i] (same house)\n",
    "3. No house appears in both training and testing sets\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, you're truly testing on \"unseen\" data, which gives you a realistic estimate of how your model will perform when predicting prices for new houses not in your original dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What happens when `model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)` runs?\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm uses mathematical optimization to find the line that minimizes the difference between predicted values and actual values across all our training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "After it runs, our model now \"knows\" the relationship between inputs and outputs. It has learned coefficients like \"for every 1-unit increase in feature A, the prediction increases by 0.3\" and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of fit() as the \"studying\" phase - the model examines all our training examples to learn the patterns, so it can make predictions on new, unseen data later."
