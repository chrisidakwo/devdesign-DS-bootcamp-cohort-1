**ANNOUNCEMENT: CAPSTONE PROJECT & CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION**

Hello everyone (@everyone),

First, sincere apologies for the delay in sharing this update. It took some time to finalize the project options, make sure datasets exist, and put everything together in a clean, easy-to-use format.

As communicated during the final week of the Bootcamp, the **Certificate of Completion** from **Dev and Design** will be awarded **only after successful completion of a capstone project**. To help with that, we've put together **11 capstone project options**, each framed as a **real-world case study** with sufficient context to guide your implementation.

### What Each Case Study Includes:

* A clear overview of the problem.
* Relevant background and contextual information.
* A description of the expected project outcomes.
* Guidance on the type of data required and how to source it.
* A breakdown of expected deliverables and their scoring weights.
* Helpful resources and tips for dataset selection, tools, and execution.

Most of the projects are tailored to the **Nigerian context** (e.g., a case study on malaria prevention in Nigeria). However, if a case is country-specific, feel free to localize it to your country of choice - what matters most is that your work aligns with the project objectives.

### Submission Details

Further communication regarding **submission instructions** will be shared via:

* `#general` and `#announcement` channels on **Discord**
* Your **email inbox** (check your spam folder too and mark it as “not spam” if it lands there)

Regardless of the project you choose, you are required to submit the following **three (3) things**:

1. **Jupyter Notebook** – Your full code with markdown notes.
2. **PDF Report** – A reasonable write-up of your analysis including visualizations and tables (where possible).
3. **PowerPoint Presentation** – A summary of your project, data selection, analysis approach, insights, and recommendations.

More details will be shared on how the presentation slides will be used.

### Access the Projects

All project case studies can be found in our Bootcamp GitHub repository:

If you’d like to explore a different topic or industry outside the listed options, just message **@nseudondian** or **@chrisidakwo** between today and Thursday, 26th June 2025.

### Timeframe

We expect that you complete the project in 2 weeks, i.e. on or before 9th of July 2025. Within this time, you can reach @nseudondian or @chrisidakwo for questions, queries, and concerns. We will ensure to allocate some time each day to respond to you.

We look forward to seeing the great work you’ll produce. Let’s finish strong!
