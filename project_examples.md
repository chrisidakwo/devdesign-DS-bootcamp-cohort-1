# PROJECT EXAMPLES

## Project 1

**Real-world Context**:
You're preparing a presentation for the Nigerian Education Committee that examines how various factors influence student academic performance. The committee wants to use this data to inform policy decisions about resource allocation and intervention programs.

**Tasks**:

1. Using the students.csv dataset, create a comprehensive visualization dashboard that addresses the following questions:
    - How do socioeconomic factors (family income, parent occupations, computers at home) affect academic performance?
    - What is the relationship between technology access (smartphones, computers) and academic performance?
    - How do study habits and extracurricular activities (daily study hours, daily gaming hours, jobs) relate to academic performance?
    - Are there significant performance differences across gender, class levels, or study groups?
    - Which subjects show the strongest correlations with each other?

2. Your dashboard should include:
    - At least 6 different types of visualizations (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots, box plots, heat maps)
    - Clear annotations highlighting key insights
    - A consistent color scheme and styling
    - Proper handling of missing values
    - A logical organization that tells a coherent story

3. Write a brief report (1-2 pages) summarizing:
    - Your key findings and their potential policy implications
    - Your visualization choices and why they were appropriate for the data
    - Any data limitations or areas for further investigation

**Submission**:
- Submit your Python script that generates the dashboard
- Include your visualization dashboard saved as a PNG or PDF
- Include your written report
- Be prepared to present your dashboard and findings in the next class


## Project 2

**Real-world Context**:
You've been hired as a data scientist by a Nigerian telecom company to help predict customer churn (customers leaving for competitors). This is your first major project, and you need to demonstrate your ability to handle the entire data science pipeline from data preparation to model evaluation.

**Tasks**:
1. Download the provided `telecom_churn.csv` dataset
2. Perform exploratory data analysis:
    - Check for missing values and outliers
    - Analyze distributions of key variables
    - Identify relationships between features and churn
3. Prepare the data for machine learning:
    - Handle missing values and outliers
    - Scale numerical features
    - Encode categorical variables
    - Select relevant features
4. Split the data into training and testing sets
5. Train a simple logistic regression model to predict churn
6. Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
7. Write a brief report (1-2 pages) summarizing your findings and recommendations for the company
